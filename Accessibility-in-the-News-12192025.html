                              <p>Most organizations start their accessibility journey in reactive mode. A complaint arrives. A defect ticket opens. A fix ships under pressure. The immediate barrier may disappear, yet the system that created it stays intact. Over time, the same issues resurface across new features, releases, and teams. Accessibility becomes a recurring cleanup task instead of a shared responsibility.</p>

                              <p>When accessibility moves from &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to &ldquo;non-functional requirement,&rdquo; everything changes: how you plan, how you manage risk, and how customers experience the product.</p>

                              <p><u></u>In early December, coinciding with the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, more than 300 CEOs and C-suite leaders from over 25 countries convened in Tokyo for SYNC25, the world&rsquo;s first accountability summit focused specifically on disability inclusion in business. Hosted by the Valuable 500, SYNC25 marked a deliberate shift away from broad pledges and toward measurable action. Senior leaders from companies including EY, P&amp;G, Sanofi and Apple took part in closed-door leadership sessions, practical workshops, and case studies examining what it actually takes to remove systemic barriers to employment, career progression, and participation for disabled people.</p>

                              <p>Join us to learn about continuing work on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2, on WCAG 3 (it's a long way off), and activities between 2 and 3. We'll also highlight updated resources to put WCAG standards in perspective and focus on the user experiences of disabled people, as well as the benefits for all &mdash; users, product owners, society.

                              <p>While the internet has become essential for accessing information, services, and communities worldwide, people with disabilities still face barriers that limit their online participation. By 2025, about 15% of the global population will live with disabilities, yet many experience difficulties navigating and interacting with web services, leading to a persistent digital divide. This study focuses on the web experiences of users with dyslexia by testing websites that claim compliance with WCAG guidelines. </p>

                              <p>When I first joined a W3C member organisation in 2009 and became its Advisory Committee representative, we were very excited about the then-new Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 standard that was released at the end of 2008. Reflecting on the accessibility journey 16 years later, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see how far we&rsquo;ve come. While there&rsquo;s always a need to be vigilant in improvement, it&rsquo;s great to see the W3C continuing its work in the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support people with disability in its online content.</p>

                              <p>Most people working in digital are aware of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and know they can help make digital products work for everyone. However, the way the guidelines are discussed often leads to mixed assumptions about what they cover and how they should be used.</p>

                              <p>A big part of disability is trying to explain our experiences, whether it be to children, bureaucrats or a new lover. In this edition I bring together my favourite quotes from recent reading. They speak to these trials of self-advocacy and much more. We get into &ldquo;cripping up&rdquo;, the moments that accessibility doesn't benefit everybody, and finding inclusion on the streets of Marrakech. And, why not, some nuns escaping from their care home.</p>

                              <p>In recent years, organizations have launched neurodiversity and mental health initiatives with the best of intentions: to raise awareness, launch employee resource groups, and create a culture where team members embrace diverse neurotypes and learn to coexist in an ecosystem. Yet, neurodivergent employees still tell me the same thing: they feel misunderstood as they navigate masking, burnout, and eventually leave organizations that genuinely believe they&rsquo;ve done their best. So, what&rsquo;s missing? The gap isn&rsquo;t in policy or process&mdash;it&rsquo;s in our understanding of the emotional landscape inside the neurodivergent experience</p>

                              <p>Digital exclusion isn&rsquo;t always obvious. For those with cognitive accessibility needs, the barriers can show up in seemingly small ways. Elements like multi-step instructions, unclear navigation, visual distractions, and even unclear icons can make everyday digital tasks feel harder than they should (or, worse, impossible to complete). And because cognitive disabilities are often non-apparent and misunderstood, usability issues affecting these groups can be overlooked in the product research and design processes.</p>

                              <p>As professionals, we&rsquo;re judged on what we produce. So-called deliverables are the artifacts produced by researchers. But what are UX research deliverables? Deliverables are almost always a digital record of inputs, outcomes, and recommendations in a document or presentation. But delivering documents and presentations fits the description of just about all knowledge worker output, so what is special about UX research deliverables?</p>

                              <p>A notion that I always hear and have heard for a long time is that meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) feels like not doing enough for accessibility . And that&rsquo;s true from a certain view. The goal of WCAG is not to create super accessible sites, it&rsquo;s to ensure basic accessibility for a wide range of users. First, as Adrian Roselli writes,&nbsp;<a href=https://adrianroselli.com/2025/12/you-cant-make-something-accessible-to-everyone.html>You Can&rsquo;t Make Something Accessible to Everyone</a>. The search for a solution that is accessible to everyone and having no drawbacks for anyone is futile. You are fighting against windmills. Accessibility is always about making compromises and finding the compromises with the fewest drawbacks.</p>

One important part of this specification defines what it means for something to be considered&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;hidden&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;during that calculation. In other words:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Which elements are ignored, and which can still be used to form an accessible name&rdquo;</em></p>

I'd love to see browsers and screen readers make use of <span class="code">&lt;time&gt;</span> like

                              <p>On the web, it&rsquo;s easy to take line breaks for granted. We get them for free between our headings, paragraphs, list items, <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> elements and more. We display them as-is in our code snippets thanks to <span class="code">&lt;pre&gt;</span>. And most magically of all, our browsers insert breaks automatically where lines of text (or other text-like &ldquo;inline&rdquo; elements) would otherwise outgrow their container. But sometimes, that isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

                              <p><u></u>I've spent over two decades immersed in the world of adaptive sports. My commitment isn't just professional; it's deeply personal. When my youngest son was paralyzed by a cancerous tumor at age two, I became fiercely determined to ensure he could access sports and experience the joy of the great outdoors. That determination has fueled my journey ever since. While significant strides have been made, there's still so much work to be done to truly provide everyone living with a disability the opportunity to be active.</p>
