                              <p>I&rsquo;ve lived long enough, and worked in accessibility long enough, to have honed a healthy skepticism when I hear about the Next Big Thing. I&rsquo;ve seen lush website launches that look great, until I activate a screen reader. Yet, in spite of it all, accessibility does evolve, but quietly rather than dramatically. As I gaze ahead to 2026, several trends are already taking shape.</p>

                              <p>Did you know that &ldquo;normal&rdquo; only started being applied to human beings in the 19th century? Isn&rsquo;t it time we accepted that disabled people are normal? Why is that even a question?

                              <p>If you have worked with HTML for a long time, you may have heard elements described as &ldquo;block-level&rdquo; or &ldquo;inline.&rdquo; These ideas came from earlier specifications and CSS defaults. They describe presentation of elements, but not their meaning. Modern HTML, defined in the HTML Living Standard, groups elements into content categories.</p>

                              <p>Modern development often sits above HTML. Developers work with frameworks, component systems, JSX, templates, and page builders. HTML can feel abstract or almost irrelevant. But HTML is still the foundation. It is the layer that browsers render, that assistive technologies interpret, and that users interact with. Every developer and tester should understand how HTML elements can be used, so that the final HTML is well formed and valid.</p>

                              <p>WCAG 3.3.1 Error Identification is a Level A conformance level Success Criterion. It highlights the importance of clear, actionable feedback when users make mistakes. It requires that any input error be automatically detected and described to the user in text, ensuring they can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>
                              <h4>Testing Methods: Labels or Instructions, December 22, 2025, Source: <a href="https://www.dennisdeacon.com/web/accessibility/testing-methods-labels-or-instructions/" target="_blank">Dennis Deacon</a></h4>
                              <p> WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions is a Level A conformance level Success Criterion. It ensures that users understand what is expected when interacting with input fields and controls. It requires that all form elements and interactive components include clear, descriptive labels or guidance that communicate their purpose and how to use them. This clarity reduces user errors, improves task completion rates, and enhances confidence for people with cognitive, learning, or visual disabilities.</p>

                              <p>WCAG 3.3.7 Redundant Entry is a Level A conformance level Success Criterion. It emphasizes reducing friction for users by preventing them from unnecessarily entering the same information multiple times. This Success Criterion, part of the broader Error Prevention guidance, is crucial for forms, applications, and transactional processes where repeated input can lead to frustration, errors, and abandonment.</p>

The former Army veteran moved to Texas in 1974 after a car crash left him quadriplegic, beginning a decades-long career of advocacy for disability rights. The Bronx native first joined the fight for accessibility in 1984 and became a pillar in the movement that balanced on-the-ground resistance with political know-how. Kafka is survived by his longtime partner and fellow advocate, Stephanie Thomas, who joined him in the long fight to increase access to public transit, Medicaid funding and voting rights for people with disabilities</p>
