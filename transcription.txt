So the empathy Factor has to be there. These are the people every day who are hands on helping individuals who have recently gone through vision loss moved here are looking for employment. These are the kinds of places that make the make a difference when it comes to disabilities in the actual field.

In terms of helping people one-on-one versus what we do is more, you know, making sure the technology that they potentially would use would be accessible as these guys actually help people one-on-one now, obviously where you live Seattle but our facilities like this. What do you what do you why is important to come out as a group you think?

We learn together. It's a great question come back to you on that. Yeah, why team building important to come as a unified front because we all really care and it's nice to be in it together so we can share the experiences and learn from each other's perspectives. You know what I think and what you think are different it's good time here together so we can bounce off of each other cool. Hey Charlie, I forgot to ask you a question. So your team is responsible for house a lapse. How do you have a ballpark idea of how many apps that involves serving? How many customers or is that like an Amy question? Amy would have a better answer that I could tell you that we actually our scope is a little bit more. Yes.

04
Everything from user testing to design Consulting to training and users. So I just asked as if I could tag along on your tour you guys a little bit so we'll have a million questions for you. That was my thought and you said you're a director of what we call it.

I'm just basically our version of some places called accessibility some places call it assistive technology.

A reception area on this floor. We have our adaptation store. We have earrings Department, which is the access technology department Community Services of get over to the right. I'm going to get through. Yeah. We also have a cooking cooking kitchen multi-purpose rooms in a video conference room as well as exam rooms UC Berkeley does come here Mondays and Wednesdays and they do low vision sisters. So instead of them having to go all the way to Berkeley the they can come here and be seen here. Yeah. So so energy devices equipment programming here because a lot of times people go to the eye doctor get a diagnosis and then just like go home really sad. Yeah diagnosis and that's it. Yeah.

Yeah, so here they're able to meet with one of our staff members and give a little of brief introduction on just devices and programming that we offer so we come over to the right onto the concrete path that you like the feel of that cane or that that magnifier actually works with your vision. So it's one of the few places in the US or someone can actually come and get Hands-On with all that stuff make a purchase and bring it back if they don't like it. So I be open by the time you're done.

Now here's you were to start a yelled at their open.

Come over here, and you can check them out. I got a cabinet. Be careful.

Conduction. Okay, okay.

So this is vibrating I can still hear you. Yeah.

So this isn't actually going in my ear. It sounds being conducted through your jaw bone. That is very cool. And the company is called aftershocks.

amazing tricks titanium f
05
I'm going to rain why is it important to have headphones that don't drink with your Canal but was it for you taking a walk riding a bike path on your kayak? You still need to know what's going on around you to keep yourself safe. Gotcha. Yeah, that's a GPS really need to be here.

And this is a relatively new technology.

Like I was supposed to take it as far as just actually a Bluetooth headset, there's music piped into and if you were to go to a website and find this you wouldn't be able to experience it. I mean, this is a meeting about it isn't straight chains telescoping canes. We have folding things and the colors being something that's exactly the colors that they put on a great little green blue magenta and orange together.

Or
06
So the heart cards made up of x's and o's in Braille.

I'm not sure what you've got playing cards Ralph. Oh, no, it's not a tactile. Rubik's Cube. I actually made one one's for real labeler. But I this just has a different shape for each color. It makes more sense than trying to spell out the colors signs for here. We have a guide dog stuff.

It's just contrast but it's so much easier to see onions and garlic on this side. Wow, really? Really simple adaptations of oh, yeah clip to the front of your oven rack. So when you're reaching in to get a pan out, oh wow.

That's good.

Not any different we just have it to let people know how much stuff it'll do and don't buy their guns way down in price as we bought this new controls. You have to memorize where they are. There's no other way to do it.

To this. So yes yet have a lighthouse but not as much.

Very very very different now. Yeah. No. I know every time I go back to the buildings are so totally like there's very little in here that I wouldn't find useful and you're not visually impaired driving glasses. What's your favorite thing?

Just too much pizza. Yeah, I'm just like and then we also have a demo room where we had some of the like higher Tech stuff that people need to make decisions about so like yeah, which kind of tablet which kind of fun. Do I want? Ya Braille displays this the Braille display is basically just an in-out terminal for the screen reader. So if you're coding for, you know, thinking about Jaws and nvda and voiceover, like someone could be augmenting that with the Braille display, but it's basically just you know, pushing the output from the screen reader and then handing to like in real life, so I'll be able to access that laboratory. Yeah, we can pop in there.

We were discussing yesterday. We can't get sort of things from drawers and kind of pressure because like the Braille display is there like, you know live text being visible on the screen for excited to stirs Community obviously signature first sighted person would put it over the piece of paper and it's a feeling here and they know to write your signature in here.
07
Can you describe your clients here? They mainly adults.

kind of program

In terms of job Readiness and if pre employment skills, and then we also have a camp up in Napa to serve more of the younger kids in the summer and can anybody in the community come in here do they need to be refer to your or anyone can come in here and a lot of people do self-refer either a family member found us on the internet. We get referrals from ophthalmologist. Social workers all different directions. And then we kind of have different funding streams different grants that we serve, you know people so they would come in to do an intake where we talk through what we offer because we offer a lot and what their needs are and then match them to different programs. I take it your website has all the numbers like how many clients or average annual report at there that I'm not good at keeping it all in my head. I know that in my

Tech department we train about 300 people a year on either screen readers magnification or both mobile devices computers Braille displays Etc. So my my little departments, he's about 300 people a year, but I know that Lighthouse reaches more. Yeah, what was this room? This is demo room so you can see there's like cctvs and different magnifiers and things around on the counters. There's little things like Kindles and iPads and stuff locked up in cabinets so they don't run away and then we'll take them out and do because a lot of times when people come in for Tech, sometimes we train them on whatever device they have and have already purchased, you know with whatever device you can afford and you already have is the right device for you. Right? But sometimes people haven't already made up her dressing decision. So we need to help them navigate like okay, you know, you could get this budget Android phone from the

You know the lifeline program or something and but here's the accessibility issues you might run into with that or you know, you're low vision. So you want the biggest screen possible for the least amount of money or just like helping them navigate those decision making because you know, our blind consumers are consumers just like anybody else. They've seen the commercials you see the advertisements for products. But like what does it really do? So like Alexa and Google home are set up in yellow she is going to ask. How do you feel? Are you a smart speaker user yourself or? Oh totally. Yeah. I bought I bought the microwave as soon as it came out Alexa Alexa. Okay for the moment. Yes. Hi. I use the Google home and for me with my cognitive disability. It's about like I have issues with time. So like setting timers like in 10 minutes remind me of this and name it this it's right. That's really cool.

Can you do what can I set a reminder for you? Not from Madonna. But yeah, I don't have Mike's particular here. So yeah, I was curious and I know I know a lot of people who have met through my accessibility meetups. A lot of people it's in so on so everybody uses the right in Seattle. We always use the yeah sure. So I did a workshop for a bunch of our seniors where we compare the two. We mean I had them like testing out different functions tell us tell us which ones better and I'm like nah, the cute little figure out. What do you want to do with it coming here in like say so, how's Rai working with your clients sometimes so we do a lot of fuck corporate.

Consulting and design work and user testing and it's usually specific to a particular product most companies kind of have their own feedback channels and aren't necessarily coming and seeking out just general feedback. We would like them to success. Yeah. Yeah that like that would be great. But often like will hear from companies when they have a very specific deliverable, you know, we're doing a study at for people who own their own small businesses and use screen readers and do function X. Can you find me 10 of those and I can and I do for a small fee but you like having just those General conversations probably the best example of that we did this event with Uber where they brought in like 20 Engineers. We brought in 20 users. And first, we just had like a discussion forum and they got all this feedback and then we did this I call it accessibility.

dating because we rotated the engineers and the different users around the room and just had them like observe people using the app, you know with Android with iOS with voice over with magnification and did this like, you know, two or three hour sort of

You know intense product dive that wasn't like a structured user testing thing. So that was you know, every I think every company kind of has their angle of like how they want things to go. So I my job is like a constant game of improv of my yes, and I will do the same thing but looks different than everyone else's version of the thing. Well sometimes companies forget the most important people in accessibility testing are people who use assistive technology and that's why we're really focused on Consulting at the design stage because my team I have by people working for me and the bulk of what they do is train end users. So when they give feedback on a designer product, like they're not just thinking from their own perspective there, you know, the thinking is someone who spends their days working with 20 year olds and 80 year olds and everybody in between. So I love that. I love having those meetings and then also the user testing where we are just facilitating that connection of product folks and

And end-users we don't really do we do some like functional reviews where we'll sit down with the developer and walk through it with the 80. I do a screen reader experience training for developers, which is like, okay if you're going to test with screen readers because I know you all do like this is how you know, a blind person is actually using the screen reader and sort of how some of those features are leveraged. We don't do just the straight-up compliance testing because there's sulfur plenty of firms to do that. That's not really the unique thing that that we can offer. How much does something like that cost something like what your walkthrough with developers. It's a depends on the size of the group somewhere, you know somewhere in the

One to two thousand dollar range depending on if it's like half day hold a big group little bit of cetera.

And just to go back to this part speakers real quick like in your experience with those types of events where you have, you know, you're exposing that you do you notice a trend which one most people go for it seems like most people go for Alexa. I don't know why I kind of keep saying her name I think for me it was because right when I moved into my place I lived in a house where my roommate actually forbid smart speakers like nope. So when I moved into my own apartment like it was right when the microwave was coming out and I was like, I was like like just the connectivity that I needed in terms of peripherals seemed more.

My experience with the Lex's that it's understands. It's probably one of the better listening, you know devices. Yeah, you don't have to repeat yourself quite as often. Yeah. I feel like I have to yell at Google to get ya attention. I have a cat named her name is like chicken noodle soup, and I recall her noodles. So when I say hi to her in the morning knowing stuff every time I Google shut off every time my partner actually is very like tinfoil hat with as he should be but so he like I have to I can only have it on his own home because he's a yeah, yeah - you know, they're collecting your data but convenience and exist. So your microwave interfaces with Alexa. Yeah. They Amazon actually just came out with an Amazon.

To microwave and so it has a button that you can hit this button and activate a like so or you can just speak to your you know, you have to have a separate Alexa it that listening the microphones are not built into the microwave but it interfaces with it. So you can tell it like defrost, you know, 16 ounces of pork and then it'll say like setting the my grades like it has all these recipes in it. Oh, so it's funny though because also I was like heat up a cup of tea and it didn't get that and then I was like heat up a cup of water and then it so like, you know, like everything else with this smart speakers like they're advertised like you can just talk to them but really it's scripted bro. One of the thing I'll tell you about this room and all of our conference rooms. Actually, you'll notice the microphones that are everywhere and that's basically for phone conferencing people in and then there's a box somewhere on the table like a box with a bunch of knobs that yeah. So that is our accessible AV interface. So from that box, you cannot visually like adjust all the volumes which is

Laptop or Apple TV or different inputs and outputs that can actually dial someone in it talks. So this was something that we had custom builds were all our conference rooms both the hardware and the software because we like that's one of the most annoying things you got to do presentations as a blind person in your lunch is my laptop connected like can you see my screen? Oh, yeah. So this kind of takes a lot out of that and also lets us we use zoom so we can do remote trainings or if one of us has to work from home like if these microphones are on and you're having a meeting, it's like you're right there in the room. So resume your guys is preferred in general or just because of the corporate. We just switched. We had a blue jeans contract in it. Got a lot worse while we were using it. So soon as it ended switch your resume because they have a lot of accessibility implementation then that's good. That's good. That's what we use to. Oh good that in Skype Skype. Yes.

Skype is kind of varies between versions. So I'll take you down to the area where we do the tech training and hopefully as you will join us because I feel like I've just hijacked her to or here. She was helping someone. So yeah, I know that's why I did it. I was like

How long do you all have I want to make sure?
08
Your office
09
The dizziness an activity that was going on around you. The attempt was to sort of do some of that with audio. So that's kind of the thought with the big staircase that connects. All three floors are being separated out. That was the design thought behind putting these little tech training spaces without doors. So they have kind of some acoustic dampering when you come in here you can tell like, you know, it's almost like you're going into like a recording studio or something where the sound just changes a little bit a little quieter in terms of sound going in or out but it's not like a little closed door off in your own little bubble.

Sort of space. Well, obviously got the zoomtext keyboards. I guess you got a Windows machine with zoomtext and jaws and nvda and then you've got an apple over there a lot more and more of our especially our older adults and people who aren't on an immediate employment track are coming to learn mobile devices. So a lot of times a lot of our students will bring their own devices for training which is ideal because if you're learning on your own device, you can take it home and practice but not always, you know, sometimes people are just learning to type just learning the software they don't have their own system yet. So they will use the ones in here so

We have five instructors who work with people. We actually do training six days a week. We have someone who comes in on Saturdays to try to catch people who might be working need some additional. What's your general like a badge for people who are coming in from mobile. He said it's typically people who are a little bit older or yeah. I mean we serve everyone 18 in my department in around 18 to I think there was somebody in their 90's learning to take a selfie for weeks ago just about the cutest thing ever, but by and large people who are getting that initial like across the digital divide tech training are probably anywhere from 30 S2 90s when we see younger, you know, eighteen to thirty year old folks. It's probably more like those Advanced screen reader in magnification skills to be able to keep up in college or in a job. So it's surprising to us. How many kids come out of high school not having a

And to touch type they maybe they just used an iPad all through school or they I don't know what they did. But some of those just core skills, you know, and and we get some pushback on that from young people like well, I just do everything with my phone like okay. I don't know any office that you go into where they're only iPhones and all the desks. Like you've got to have computer skills to kind of move forward and that's it's been interesting to sort of see that wow layout. I think a lot of times there's not a great ratio of like specialized teachers for blind kids in school. And so they can come out of K-12 Education Without those fundamental skills. So do you ever work with it so far? I'm sorry drop do you ever work with employers like someone comes here and say I got a job?

No, I'm having some Vision issues. Yeah. Yeah, we do make it less quote-unquote scary for the employer. Right? I mean a lot of our focus is on, you know, just getting that employee sort of set up and our employment folks could probably speak more to that if they do sort of General employer education. We've definitely gone and done things where we've like gone to someone's work site walked through their workflow figured out, you know, what's screen reader skills, they could leverage and and sometimes had to go back to the employer and say like, okay this document that they're asking them to use, you know is not accessible like because so often the employer will come to us like you need to just teach them so they can just do their job and like, you know, the employers not really owning up to like hmm. We have this huge non-uniform table with no column headers and row headers, like maybe it's not going to be super efficient for that person entering information like the PDF files without accent, right?

Someone's recently found themselves blind low vision and your job is incredibly inaccessible. We don't have legal services, but there's actually a disability rights lawyer Tre legal who rents space in our building. So we have a good person to refer people to if it you know, if it comes to that yeah, that's good. That's that was kind of the last step course, you know, my first response to anybody is not usually like we're up. It's like, hey, let's talk but that is the weight behind the hey, let's talk, you know, by the way, yeah.

It comes up sometimes people are afraid to tell their employers like they're having performance issues, but they're afraid to disclose I was talking to someone last week and I was like, it's like well, I'm afraid it could affect my job and I'm like, okay, I'm not going to tell you it never would but if it did like you would have legal recourse recourse, you know you and if you're having performance issues, you might want to just close and he has a believe me they know, you know, because he's walking around without a cane without a screen reader, you know, running into stuff and holding papers up to his face. So he had the we had the tough love talk in the cognitive disabilities face every article you read is dumped as close as well. Yeah, you can't find an article online written by a professional who says dude is closed. So it's kind of interesting the differentiation between that right. So yeah. So yeah, we have three little rooms like this and kind of different configurations.

Asians where the tech training happens and like I said, we do some workshops but a lot of it is one on one just because everyone comes in at a different skill level and has different interests how many employees around the hundred and forty now, but we have satellite offices in the North Coast in

Berkeley in Marin and San Leandro so not everybody who works for Lighthouse works right here you guys I saw that you guys have plenty of employees. Do you guys have volunteer events volunteer staff? Yeah. We have a full time volunteer coordinator and there's volunteers who work with blind people one-on-one things like shopping and read email those sorts of things. We have Community groups because that oh, that's something I didn't mention is that we have a whole Community Services Department that does things like

You know, they just did like a community ice skating event, or I'm totally blanking right now, but they do that the youth programming. Oh health and fitness. We have a full-time health and fitness coordinator. So there's yoga classes. There's like hey, this is how you just go out to the gym in your community and you know do Fitness activities. All right, because as you come back and join us
10
So first of all, your name is Aaron Villanueva. Yes and your position at Wells Fargo is excessively user experience writer writer. Okay, and just a little background on yourself what got I know you've said this in your profile, but I just get it again in your own words. What got you interested in accessibility. Well one, I guess one of the biggest fears I had it was a tie to might one day be disabled and that's something that I've always wondered about and how could I better to Future especially when one day I'm gonna have the ability to continue on coding run? So for me, I'm always constantly thinking about all right. So what can I do? What can I do now to actually help people with disabilities and hopefully someday you can help myself in the future if I ever become disabled, so I'm very curious to know more about it and continue to learn more about it. Just because you know,

An incident happened to me one day. I was feeling great and in the next days, you know, I just went to the hospital and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis, especially when right now, I'm still constantly learning a little bit of martial arts. You know when something happens to my bones then what hmm. So yeah. I mean, I'm very curious to know more. I've got more curious about ever since thought of the fear of you know, getting my arms broken or getting my fingers broken are getting anything broken having a permanently damaged.

So you're relatively new to the field. What does it mean to you to be visiting?

an organization that deals with people with disabilities, I imagine if we were

I don't know. We were working at a place that sold online and Online Marketplace. Okay, there wouldn't be an equivalent. Maybe you could go to Old Warehouse that had all the goods in it or or see the delivery system.

But I what's what's the significance to you of visiting a place that deals with people with disabilities? What do you hope to learn in the visit you guys as a question going? Well, okay. So we're it's I guess let me try first another way. So accessibility is something that touches people in a very personal way I guess because

it's not like, you know, you're going to Amazon and you're ordering. I don't know what a new headset or something. You're right, you know, you could if you'd worked at Amazon and you were

As to do Mark some sort of field research, you might end up going to one of the suppliers, I guess or or one of the warehouses that Amazon uses to distribute its goods but here we're going to a place that it treats human beings with disabilities are I was just wondering what do you think? Why do you think it's important to to do that kind of Outreach research, see how people disabilities are being cared for treated services that better way of phrasing it.

Hey, I'm gonna think about that. So you're we're going to the place which is how I'm assuming the lighthouse. Yeah. Yeah, so we're going to the lighthouse and I'm new to this right in there. So I'm Norfolk I'm going to be exposed to something that I'm telling them which is going to a place that really is all about accessibility, right? Uh-huh helping other people and your question is how is that?

How does it how do you feel about how do I feel about yeah, yeah, you know, I'm a very curious. I really want to know more. Okay, I wanna know more about the technology and everything that they're using and seeing how it helps. I mean, I don't know exactly like what specific disabilities are reaching out to but let's say if they were reaching out to every single specific disability. So folks with me or more disabilities cognitive disabilities folks who are blind who are are not side of users our folks who are colorblind folks who are deaf, you know, like if they're reaching out to as many as I can. I'm very curious to know how this one place like that happened you guys.

So I'm Norfolk I'm going to be exposed to something that I'm telling them which is going to a place that really is all about accessibility, right? Uh-huh helping other people and your question is how is that?

How does it how do you feel about how do I feel about yeah, yeah, you know, I'm a very curious. I really want to know more. Okay, I wanna know more about the technology and everything that they're using and seeing how it helps. I mean, I don't know exactly like what specific disabilities are reaching out to but let's say if they were reaching out to every single specific disability. So folks with me or more disabilities cognitive disabilities folks who are blind who are are not side of users our folks who are colorblind folks who are deaf, you know, like if they're reaching out to as many as I can. I'm very curious to know how this one place like that happened you guys.
13
So first of all, your name is Aaron Villanueva. Yes and your position at Wells Fargo is excessively user experience writer writer. Okay, and just a little background on yourself what got I know you've said this in your profile, but I just get it again in your own words. What got you interested in accessibility. Well one, I guess one of the biggest fears I had it was a tie to might one day be disabled and that's something that I've always wondered about and how could I better to Future especially when one day I'm gonna have the ability to continue on coding run? So for me, I'm always constantly thinking about all right. So what can I do? What can I do now to actually help people with disabilities and hopefully someday you can help myself in the future if I ever become disabled, so I'm very curious to know more about it and continue to learn more about it. Just because you know,

An incident happened to me one day. I was feeling great and in the next days, you know, I just went to the hospital and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis, especially when right now, I'm still constantly learning a little bit of martial arts. You know when something happens to my bones then what hmm. So yeah. I mean, I'm very curious to know more. I've got more curious about ever since thought of the fear of you know, getting my arms broken or getting my fingers broken are getting anything broken having a permanently damaged.

So you're relatively new to the field. What does it mean to you to be visiting?

an organization that deals with people with disabilities, I imagine if we were

I don't know. We were working at a place that sold online and Online Marketplace. Okay, there wouldn't be an equivalent. Maybe you could go to Old Warehouse that had all the goods in it or or see the delivery system.

But I what's what's the significance to you of visiting a place that deals with people with disabilities? What do you hope to learn in the visit you guys as a question going? Well, okay. So we're it's I guess let me try first another way. So accessibility is something that touches people in a very personal way I guess because

it's not like, you know, you're going to Amazon and you're ordering. I don't know what a new headset or something. You're right, you know, you could if you'd worked at Amazon and you were

As to do Mark some sort of field research, you might end up going to one of the suppliers, I guess or or one of the warehouses that Amazon uses to distribute its goods but here we're going to a place that it treats human beings with disabilities are I was just wondering what do you think? Why do you think it's important to to do that kind of Outreach research, see how people disabilities are being cared for treated services that better way of phrasing it.

So the heart cards made up of x's and o's in Braille.

I'm not sure what you've got playing cards Ralph. Oh, no, it's not a tactile. Rubik's Cube. I actually made one one's for real labeler. But I this just has a different shape for each color. It makes more sense than trying to spell out the colors signs for here. We have a guide dog stuff.

It's just contrast but it's so much easier to see onions and garlic on this side. Wow, really? Really simple adaptations of oh, yeah clip to the front of your oven rack. So when you're reaching in to get a pan out, oh wow.

Not any different we just have it to let people know how much stuff it'll do and don't buy their guns way down in price as we bought this new controls. You have to memorize where they are. There's no other way to do it.

To this. So yes yet have a lighthouse but not as much.

Very very very different now. Yeah. No. I know every time I go back to the buildings are so totally like there's very little in here that I wouldn't find useful and you're not visually impaired driving glasses. What's your favorite thing?

Just too much pizza. Yeah, I'm just like and then we also have a demo room where we had some of the like higher Tech stuff that people need to make decisions about so like yeah, which kind of tablet which kind of fun. Do I want? Ya Braille displays this the Braille display is basically just an in-out terminal for the screen reader. So if you're coding for, you know, thinking about Jaws and nvda and voiceover, like someone could be augmenting that with the Braille display, but it's basically just you know, pushing the output from the screen reader and then handing to like in real life, so I'll be able to access that laboratory. Yeah, we can pop in there.

We were discussing yesterday. We can't get sort of things from drawers and kind of pressure because like the Braille display is there like, you know live text being visible on the screen for excited to stirs Community obviously signature first sighted person would put it over the piece of paper and it's a feeling here and they know to write your signature in here.

That's good.

Not any different we just have it to let people know how much stuff it'll do and don't buy their guns way down in price as we bought this new controls. You have to memorize where they are. There's no other way to do it.

Can you describe your clients here? They mainly adults.

kind of program

In terms of job Readiness and if pre employment skills, and then we also have a camp up in Napa to serve more of the younger kids in the summer and can anybody in the community come in here do they need to be refer to your or anyone can come in here and a lot of people do self-refer either a family member found us on the internet. We get referrals from ophthalmologist. Social workers all different directions. And then we kind of have different funding streams different grants that we serve, you know people so they would come in to do an intake where we talk through what we offer because we offer a lot and what their needs are and then match them to different programs. I take it your website has all the numbers like how many clients or average annual report at there that I'm not good at keeping it all in my head. I know that in my

Tech department we train about 300 people a year on either screen readers magnification or both mobile devices computers Braille displays Etc. So my my little departments, he's about 300 people a year, but I know that Lighthouse reaches more. Yeah, what was this room? This is demo room so you can see there's like cctvs and different magnifiers and things around on the counters. There's little things like Kindles and iPads and stuff locked up in cabinets so they don't run away and then we'll take them out and do because a lot of times when people come in for Tech, sometimes we train them on whatever device they have and have already purchased, you know with whatever device you can afford and you already have is the right device for you. Right? But sometimes people haven't already made up her dressing decision. So we need to help them navigate like okay, you know, you could get this budget Android phone from the

You know the lifeline program or something and but here's the accessibility issues you might run into with that or you know, you're low vision. So you want the biggest screen possible for the least amount of money or just like helping them navigate those decision making because you know, our blind consumers are consumers just like anybody else. They've seen the commercials you see the advertisements for products. But like what does it really do? So like Alexa and Google home are set up in yellow she is going to ask. How do you feel? Are you a smart speaker user yourself or? Oh totally. Yeah. I bought I bought the microwave as soon as it came out Alexa Alexa. Okay for the moment. Yes. Hi. I use the Google home and for me with my cognitive disability. It's about like I have issues with time. So like setting timers like in 10 minutes remind me of this and name it this it's right. That's really cool.

Can you do what can I set a reminder for you? Not from Madonna. But yeah, I don't have Mike's particular here. So yeah, I was curious and I know I know a lot of people who have met through my accessibility meetups. A lot of people it's in so on so everybody uses the right in Seattle. We always use the yeah sure. So I did a workshop for a bunch of our seniors where we compare the two. We mean I had them like testing out different functions tell us tell us which ones better and I'm like nah, the cute little figure out. What do you want to do with it coming here in like say so, how's Rai working with your clients sometimes so we do a lot of fuck corporate.

Consulting and design work and user testing and it's usually specific to a particular product most companies kind of have their own feedback channels and aren't necessarily coming and seeking out just general feedback. We would like them to success. Yeah. Yeah that like that would be great. But often like will hear from companies when they have a very specific deliverable, you know, we're doing a study at for people who own their own small businesses and use screen readers and do function X. Can you find me 10 of those and I can and I do for a small fee but you like having just those General conversations probably the best example of that we did this event with Uber where they brought in like 20 Engineers. We brought in 20 users. And first, we just had like a discussion forum and they got all this feedback and then we did this I call it accessibility.

dating because we rotated the engineers and the different users around the room and just had them like observe people using the app, you know with Android with iOS with voice over with magnification and did this like, you know, two or three hour sort of

You know intense product dive that wasn't like a structured user testing thing. So that was you know, every I think every company kind of has their angle of like how they want things to go. So I my job is like a constant game of improv of my yes, and I will do the same thing but looks different than everyone else's version of the thing. Well sometimes companies forget the most important people in accessibility testing are people who use assistive technology and that's why we're really focused on Consulting at the design stage because my team I have by people working for me and the bulk of what they do is train end users. So when they give feedback on a designer product, like they're not just thinking from their own perspective there, you know, the thinking is someone who spends their days working with 20 year olds and 80 year olds and everybody in between. So I love that. I love having those meetings and then also the user testing where we are just facilitating that connection of product folks and

And end-users we don't really do we do some like functional reviews where we'll sit down with the developer and walk through it with the 80. I do a screen reader experience training for developers, which is like, okay if you're going to test with screen readers because I know you all do like this is how you know, a blind person is actually using the screen reader and sort of how some of those features are leveraged. We don't do just the straight-up compliance testing because there's sulfur plenty of firms to do that. That's not really the unique thing that that we can offer. How much does something like that cost something like what your walkthrough with developers. It's a depends on the size of the group somewhere, you know somewhere in the

One to two thousand dollar range depending on if it's like half day hold a big group little bit of cetera.

And just to go back to this part speakers real quick like in your experience with those types of events where you have, you know, you're exposing that you do you notice a trend which one most people go for it seems like most people go for Alexa. I don't know why I kind of keep saying her name I think for me it was because right when I moved into my place I lived in a house where my roommate actually forbid smart speakers like nope. So when I moved into my own apartment like it was right when the microwave was coming out and I was like, I was like like just the connectivity that I needed in terms of peripherals seemed more.

My experience with the Lex's that it's understands. It's probably one of the better listening, you know devices. Yeah, you don't have to repeat yourself quite as often. Yeah. I feel like I have to yell at Google to get ya attention. I have a cat named her name is like chicken noodle soup, and I recall her noodles. So when I say hi to her in the morning knowing stuff every time I Google shut off every time my partner actually is very like tinfoil hat with as he should be but so he like I have to I can only have it on his own home because he's a yeah, yeah - you know, they're collecting your data but convenience and exist. So your microwave interfaces with Alexa. Yeah. They Amazon actually just came out with an Amazon.

To microwave and so it has a button that you can hit this button and activate a like so or you can just speak to your you know, you have to have a separate Alexa it that listening the microphones are not built into the microwave but it interfaces with it. So you can tell it like defrost, you know, 16 ounces of pork and then it'll say like setting the my grades like it has all these recipes in it. Oh, so it's funny though because also I was like heat up a cup of tea and it didn't get that and then I was like heat up a cup of water and then it so like, you know, like everything else with this smart speakers like they're advertised like you can just talk to them but really it's scripted bro. One of the thing I'll tell you about this room and all of our conference rooms. Actually, you'll notice the microphones that are everywhere and that's basically for phone conferencing people in and then there's a box somewhere on the table like a box with a bunch of knobs that yeah. So that is our accessible AV interface. So from that box, you cannot visually like adjust all the volumes which is

Laptop or Apple TV or different inputs and outputs that can actually dial someone in it talks. So this was something that we had custom builds were all our conference rooms both the hardware and the software because we like that's one of the most annoying things you got to do presentations as a blind person in your lunch is my laptop connected like can you see my screen? Oh, yeah. So this kind of takes a lot out of that and also lets us we use zoom so we can do remote trainings or if one of us has to work from home like if these microphones are on and you're having a meeting, it's like you're right there in the room. So resume your guys is preferred in general or just because of the corporate. We just switched. We had a blue jeans contract in it. Got a lot worse while we were using it. So soon as it ended switch your resume because they have a lot of accessibility implementation then that's good. That's good. That's what we use to. Oh good that in Skype Skype. Yes.

Skype is kind of varies between versions. So I'll take you down to the area where we do the tech training and hopefully as you will join us because I feel like I've just hijacked her to or here. She was helping someone. So yeah, I know that's why I did it. I was like

How long do you all have I want to make sure?

In terms of job Readiness and if pre employment skills, and then we also have a camp up in Napa to serve more of the younger kids in the summer and can anybody in the community come in here do they need to be refer to your or anyone can come in here and a lot of people do self-refer either a family member found us on the internet. We get referrals from ophthalmologist. Social workers all different directions. And then we kind of have different funding streams different grants that we serve, you know people so they would come in to do an intake where we talk through what we offer because we offer a lot and what their needs are and then match them to different programs. I take it your website has all the numbers like how many clients or average annual report at there that I'm not good at keeping it all in my head. I know that in my

Tech department we train about 300 people a year on either screen readers magnification or both mobile devices computers Braille displays Etc. So my my little departments, he's about 300 people a year, but I know that Lighthouse reaches more. Yeah, what was this room? This is demo room so you can see there's like cctvs and different magnifiers and things around on the counters. There's little things like Kindles and iPads and stuff locked up in cabinets so they don't run away and then we'll take them out and do because a lot of times when people come in for Tech, sometimes we train them on whatever device they have and have already purchased, you know with whatever device you can afford and you already have is the right device for you. Right? But sometimes people haven't already made up her dressing decision. So we need to help them navigate like okay, you know, you could get this budget Android phone from the

You know the lifeline program or something and but here's the accessibility issues you might run into with that or you know, you're low vision. So you want the biggest screen possible for the least amount of money or just like helping them navigate those decision making because you know, our blind consumers are consumers just like anybody else. They've seen the commercials you see the advertisements for products. But like what does it really do? So like Alexa and Google home are set up in yellow she is going to ask. How do you feel? Are you a smart speaker user yourself or? Oh totally. Yeah. I bought I bought the microwave as soon as it came out Alexa Alexa. Okay for the moment. Yes. Hi. I use the Google home and for me with my cognitive disability. It's about like I have issues with time. So like setting timers like in 10 minutes remind me of this and name it this it's right. That's really cool.

Can you do what can I set a reminder for you? Not from Madonna. But yeah, I don't have Mike's particular here. So yeah, I was curious and I know I know a lot of people who have met through my accessibility meetups. A lot of people it's in so on so everybody uses the right in Seattle. We always use the yeah sure. So I did a workshop for a bunch of our seniors where we compare the two. We mean I had them like testing out different functions tell us tell us which ones better and I'm like nah, the cute little figure out. What do you want to do with it coming here in like say so, how's Rai working with your clients sometimes so we do a lot of fuck corporate.

Consulting and design work and user testing and it's usually specific to a particular product most companies kind of have their own feedback channels and aren't necessarily coming and seeking out just general feedback. We would like them to success. Yeah. Yeah that like that would be great. But often like will hear from companies when they have a very specific deliverable, you know, we're doing a study at for people who own their own small businesses and use screen readers and do function X. Can you find me 10 of those and I can and I do for a small fee but you like having just those General conversations probably the best example of that we did this event with Uber where they brought in like 20 Engineers. We brought in 20 users. And first, we just had like a discussion forum and they got all this feedback and then we did this I call it accessibility.

dating because we rotated the engineers and the different users around the room and just had them like observe people using the app, you know with Android with iOS with voice over with magnification and did this like, you know, two or three hour sort of

You know intense product dive that wasn't like a structured user testing thing. So that was you know, every I think every company kind of has their angle of like how they want things to go. So I my job is like a constant game of improv of my yes, and I will do the same thing but looks different than everyone else's version of the thing. Well sometimes companies forget the most important people in accessibility testing are people who use assistive technology and that's why we're really focused on Consulting at the design stage because my team I have by people working for me and the bulk of what they do is train end users. So when they give feedback on a designer product, like they're not just thinking from their own perspective there, you know, the thinking is someone who spends their days working with 20 year olds and 80 year olds and everybody in between. So I love that. I love having those meetings and then also the user testing where we are just facilitating that connection of product folks and

And end-users we don't really do we do some like functional reviews where we'll sit down with the developer and walk through it with the 80. I do a screen reader experience training for developers, which is like, okay if you're going to test with screen readers because I know you all do like this is how you know, a blind person is actually using the screen reader and sort of how some of those features are leveraged. We don't do just the straight-up compliance testing because there's sulfur plenty of firms to do that. That's not really the unique thing that that we can offer. How much does something like that cost something like what your walkthrough with developers. It's a depends on the size of the group somewhere, you know somewhere in the

One to two thousand dollar range depending on if it's like half day hold a big group little bit of cetera.

And just to go back to this part speakers real quick like in your experience with those types of events where you have, you know, you're exposing that you do you notice a trend which one most people go for it seems like most people go for Alexa. I don't know why I kind of keep saying her name I think for me it was because right when I moved into my place I lived in a house where my roommate actually forbid smart speakers like nope. So when I moved into my own apartment like it was right when the microwave was coming out and I was like, I was like like just the connectivity that I needed in terms of peripherals seemed more.

My experience with the Lex's that it's understands. It's probably one of the better listening, you know devices. Yeah, you don't have to repeat yourself quite as often. Yeah. I feel like I have to yell at Google to get ya attention. I have a cat named her name is like chicken noodle soup, and I recall her noodles. So when I say hi to her in the morning knowing stuff every time I Google shut off every time my partner actually is very like tinfoil hat with as he should be but so he like I have to I can only have it on his own home because he's a yeah, yeah - you know, they're collecting your data but convenience and exist. So your microwave interfaces with Alexa. Yeah. They Amazon actually just came out with an Amazon.

To microwave and so it has a button that you can hit this button and activate a like so or you can just speak to your you know, you have to have a separate Alexa it that listening the microphones are not built into the microwave but it interfaces with it. So you can tell it like defrost, you know, 16 ounces of pork and then it'll say like setting the my grades like it has all these recipes in it. Oh, so it's funny though because also I was like heat up a cup of tea and it didn't get that and then I was like heat up a cup of water and then it so like, you know, like everything else with this smart speakers like they're advertised like you can just talk to them but really it's scripted bro. One of the thing I'll tell you about this room and all of our conference rooms. Actually, you'll notice the microphones that are everywhere and that's basically for phone conferencing people in and then there's a box somewhere on the table like a box with a bunch of knobs that yeah. So that is our accessible AV interface. So from that box, you cannot visually like adjust all the volumes which is

Laptop or Apple TV or different inputs and outputs that can actually dial someone in it talks. So this was something that we had custom builds were all our conference rooms both the hardware and the software because we like that's one of the most annoying things you got to do presentations as a blind person in your lunch is my laptop connected like can you see my screen? Oh, yeah. So this kind of takes a lot out of that and also lets us we use zoom so we can do remote trainings or if one of us has to work from home like if these microphones are on and you're having a meeting, it's like you're right there in the room. So resume your guys is preferred in general or just because of the corporate. We just switched. We had a blue jeans contract in it. Got a lot worse while we were using it. So soon as it ended switch your resume because they have a lot of accessibility implementation then that's good. That's good. That's what we use to. Oh good that in Skype Skype. Yes.

Skype is kind of varies between versions. So I'll take you down to the area where we do the tech training and hopefully as you will join us because I feel like I've just hijacked her to or here. She was helping someone. So yeah, I know that's why I did it. I was like

How long do you all have I want to make sure?
