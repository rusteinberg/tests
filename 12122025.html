                              <p>Accessibility is often framed as a gigantic task that requires attention to everything at once. People sometimes describe that type of endless activity as “boiling the ocean.” The phrase reflects how things feel when accessibility relies on a small group of experts trying to fix every defect created by everyone else. The ocean still boils long after the specialists burn out. People with disabilities wait for progress that never seems to arrive. Success requires a different approach.</p>

                              <p>In the rush to make digital products accessible, many teams lean on a single accessibility score or grade to convey how good (or bad) a product is from the accessibility point of view. An example of this might be 92 percent accessible, Grade A-, or 68 % accessible, D+. To non-accessibility professionals, these grades feel reassuring and objective. Yet these scores tell a fraction of the story, and often the wrong fraction.</p>

                      <p><u></u>College exams used to be a two-hour sprint packed with months of material. But now at some of America&rsquo;s most prestigious universities, they&rsquo;re turning into logistical marathons. And one of the fastest-growing academic advantages has nothing to do with test prep, tutoring or even talent. Professors say they&rsquo;re struggling to keep pace as more undergraduates register for academic accommodations, especially at elite schools like Brown, Harvard, Amherst and Stanford. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 28.7% of U.S. adults have a disability, but on these campuses, the share is even higher.</p>

The battle over who can skip long lines on popular rides because of their disabilities marks the latest struggle by Disney to accommodate disabled visitors while cracking down on past abuses. But some Disney fans say the company has gone too far and has no right to determine who is disabled.</p>

Here&rsquo;s a simple model that shows the key steps &mdash; from the event firing, to DOM updates, to changes in the accessibility tree, and finally the AXEvent that reaches assistive technologies. </p>

                              <p>An AXEvent is a notification generated by the browser when something meaningful changes in the accessibility tree and needs to be communicated to assistive technologies. Note: &ldquo;AXEvent&rdquo; is Chrome&rsquo;s internal term. WebKit and Firefox use different names, but the underlying concept is the same: an accessibility event fired when the AXTree changes in a meaningful way.</p>

                              <p>Over the years, I've seen many design systems try to implement a <Tooltip> component for consumers to use, and imo the one thing they have in common is that they will not be used as intended.

That's not behavior that you had to specify with an onclick handler, the browser just infers it from the relationship between the elements.</p>

                              <p><u></u>Employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say a Trump administration policy change is making it nearly impossible for agency staff with disabilities to access telework as a reasonable accommodation. Political appointees at the agency are repealing previously approved reasonable accommodation requests as the agency implements a new Health and Human Services policy for those with disabilities, according to documents and internal communications obtained by CQ Roll Call. Legal experts who reviewed the policy change say it may circumvent requirements that federal employers provide a reasonable accommodation to employees with a disability unless it causes an &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; on the agency.</p>

In a case filed on Dec. 5, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Eastern Division, former AT&amp;T Enterprises, LLC employee Kimberly Wall sets out how a mandatory return-to-office policy, layered over long-standing medical issues, allegedly led to the end of her employment. Wall, who lives in Wilmington, N.C., says she joined AT&amp;T on or about August 12, 2002, as a call center representative and was later promoted to a Lead role, including in project management and development.</p>

Specifically, the ADA 30 Days to Comply Act will create a process for disabled individuals to notify business directly about ADA violations, allowing these entities a 30-day remediation window to address the issue or show significant progress if a longer period is needed.</p>
