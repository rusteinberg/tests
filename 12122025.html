                              <p>Accessibility is often framed as a gigantic task that requires attention to everything at once. People sometimes describe that type of endless activity as “boiling the ocean.” The phrase reflects how things feel when accessibility relies on a small group of experts trying to fix every defect created by everyone else. The ocean still boils long after the specialists burn out. People with disabilities wait for progress that never seems to arrive. Success requires a different approach.</p>

                              <p>In the rush to make digital products accessible, many teams lean on a single accessibility score or grade to convey how good (or bad) a product is from the accessibility point of view. An example of this might be 92 percent accessible, Grade A-, or 68 % accessible, D+. To non-accessibility professionals, these grades feel reassuring and objective. Yet these scores tell a fraction of the story, and often the wrong fraction.</p>

                              <p>The DOM is a tree-like structure representing all elements in the document. It is a live, reactive browser data structure, not a passive copy of your HTML. DOM mutations are any changes to this tree. These mutations can happen with or without JavaScript.</p>

                              <p>Ever wondered how a browser turns an interaction into a screen reader announcement? Here&rsquo;s a simple model that shows the key steps &mdash; from the event firing, to DOM updates, to changes in the accessibility tree, and finally the AXEvent that reaches assistive technologies. </p>
                              <h4>What is an AXEvent? December 5, 2025, Source: <a href="https://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/axevents.html" target="_blank">Max Design</a></h4>
                              <p>An AXEvent is a notification generated by the browser when something meaningful changes in the accessibility tree and needs to be communicated to assistive technologies. Note: &ldquo;AXEvent&rdquo; is Chrome&rsquo;s internal term. WebKit and Firefox use different names, but the underlying concept is the same: an accessibility event fired when the AXTree changes in a meaningful way.</p>

                              <p>Over the years, I've seen many design systems try to implement a <Tooltip> component for consumers to use, and imo the one thing they have in common is that they will not be used as intended. From an API design perspective, that likely means that the <Tooltip> component is an abstraction that is too low level, which leads me to today's hot take.</p>

                                        <p>As a frontend engineer, I think it is very important to make sure that anything I work on is accessible and usable by anyone and everyone.

That's not behavior that you had to specify with an onclick handler, the browser just infers it from the relationship between the elements.</p>

                              <p>WCAG 2.5.7 Dragging Movements is a Level AA conformance level Success Criterion. It is all about ensuring that interaction is never a barrier. It requires that any functionality relying on a dragging gesture, such as click-and-drag, press-and-hold, or swipe-to-move, can also be operated with a single-pointer action like a simple click or tap. </p>

                              <p>Why your beautiful UI becomes unreadable the moment it hits a TV screen&mdash;and how to fix it. The user experience for TV aligns more with billboard design than with app design, and cannot be treated as a simple enlargement of mobile interfaces. The challenges of viewing distance, screen variability, lighting conditions, and non-touch interaction all collide&mdash;and small typography and low contrast are usually the first things to break. It&rsquo;s a reminder&mdash;especially on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities&mdash;that accessibility isn&rsquo;t a side note, but central to resilient design. . Here&rsquo;s how to fix them before your users struggle, squint, or churn.</p>

                      <p tabindex="-1" itemprop="headline name">In the architecture of a user interface, buttons are the fundamental units of action. They are the triggers for submitting data, initiating processes, and manipulating content. While seemingly simple, the design and implementation of a button carry profound implications for the accessibility and usability of a digital product. An inaccessible button is more than a minor inconvenience; it is a locked door, preventing a segment of the user base from accessing core functionality. This guide provides a comprehensive technical framework for designing and developing web buttons that are not only compliant with international standards but are genuinely usable by people with a wide range of abilities.</p>
